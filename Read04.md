#### JavaScript
what is js:JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.
- every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes.
- First create Js file called main.js or app.js, and save it.
- n your index.html file, enter this code on a new line, just before the closing ```</body>``` tag: ```<script src="main.js"></script>```
- to define variabl use ```var "name of your variable" = assign value```
  - js allows you to assign is value without extra variables like in C++ you have to specify the assigned way.
  - if statement for and switch work same as the most language
    -here you can find the syntax for``` if (condition) {
    //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true}
   else {
    //  block of code to be executed if the condition is false} ```
  - else if ```if (condition1) {
    //  block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
  } else if (condition2) {
    //  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
  } else {
    //  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false }```
  - for, switch also same and many more.
- like other programming languages Operators are important
  -  math 
  - logical and mathematical comparators are also important.
- Functions are all over the plase ```let myVariable = document.querySelector('h1'); alert('hello!');``` ```document.querySelector, alert```Functions let you iplemant ways to interact with the user.
- API Functions ```localStorage```, allows us to store data in the browser and retrieve it later, ```setItem() function to create and store a data item```
- ```<input form="form_id">``` get information from the user, The```id`` attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document.
