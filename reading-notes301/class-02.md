# React lifecycle

## Each component in React has a lifecycle that goes through three main phases Mounting, Updating, and Unrounding. The react lifecycle method is used in the React class component

- `componentDidMount()`: This method is called after the component is rendered to the DOM.
- `componentDidUpdate()`: This method is called after the component is updated.
- `componentWillUnmount()`: This method is called before the component is removed from the DOM.
- `render()`: This method is called to render the component.
