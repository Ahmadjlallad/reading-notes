## Images

- addIng Images `<img>` `src`This tells the browser where
  it can find the image file `alt` This provides a text description
  of the image

- If you are building a site from scratch, it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images the site uses.

- Where to plaCe Images In Your Code
  - 1: before a paragraph The paragraph starts on a new line after the image.
  - InsIde the start of a paragraph The first row of text aligns with the bottom of the image.
  - In the mIddle of a paragraph The image is placed between the words of the paragraph that it appears in
- three rules for CreatIng Images
  - Save Images In the right format ,size ,resolutIon
- Images created for the web should be saved at a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution of the image, the larger the size of the file.
- Vector Images are graphical representations of mathematical objects such as lines, curves, polygons and its like. These graphics are generated by computer and they follow x and y axis as their reference definition.
- A Bitmap image or graphic is made up of pixels, Because it is a lossy compression format, once you expand a JPEG too far beyond its original dimensions, the image becomes very distorted and low quality.you can increase the dimensions of the image without affecting the quality of it.

* **_GIF_** for animations.
* **_JPEG _** colorful images.
* **_PNG_** generic, images with text everting.
