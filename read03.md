* **Structure web pages with HTML**
  in the past learned that HTML is HyperText Markup Language the standard markup language for creating Web pages, consists of a series of elements to tell the browser how to display the content
  * for example 
    * ```<head>```element contains meta information about the HTML page
    * ```<body>```defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents.
    * ```<h1>``` defines a large heading and ```<p>``` defines a paragraph. 
  * Element element is defined by a start tag, ```<tagname>Content</tagname>```
    * for example to get italic text ```<em>``` tag, you can do nesting elements ``` <p>Content<em>Content</em> Content</p>``` this way ```<em>```  is an inline element but ```<p>```is a block-level element.
    * self closing elements ```<img src= "img link"> close it self without closing tag.
  * Attributes  contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content.
    * for example to link a website you can use ```<a>``` but you have to set 3 attributes ```href```specifies the web address for the link```title```of the page```target```for how will you display it```target="_blank"``` will display the link in a new tab ```<p> This is <a href="https://ahmadjlallad.github.io/reading-notes/" title="my web page" target="_blank">my web page</a></p>```
