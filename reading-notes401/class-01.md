## A simple set of steps

I am going to give you a simple set of steps to follow which you can use for any algorithm type programming problem.

1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Optimize the real code.

## Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive

In reality, a lot of people are living a frenzied, busy life. They wear their business as a badge of honor, and brag about their full schedules.
Frankly, most people prefer the little dopamine boost of checking boxes on a to-do list than actually getting important work done.
How do you value your time?
Take stock of the things you did this week. How many of them were worthy of $1,000/hour?
How many activities were a true waste of time?
Value your time at what it deserves to be. The higher the value, the more important and productive work you’ll do — and the less trivial and mindless tasks you’ll get caught in.

## 5 Whys Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly

1. Assemble a Team
   Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix. Include someone to act as a facilitator , who can keep the team focused on identifying effective counter-measures.

2. Define the Problem
   If you can, observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on. For example, "Team A isn't meeting its response time targets" or "Software release B resulted in too many rollback failures."

3. Ask the First "Why?"
   Ask your team why the problem is occurring. (For example, "Why isn't Team A meeting its response time targets?")
4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times
   For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further "whys" in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you've just recorded.
5. Know When to Stop
6. Address the Root Cause(s)
7. Monitor Your Measures
