# Stacks and Queues

What is a Stack: stack (sometimes called a “push-down stack”) is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and the removal of existing items always takes place at the same end. This end is commonly referred to as the “top.” The end opposite the top is known as the “base.”

- Stacks follow these concepts:

- FILO

  - First In Last Out

- LIFO
  - Last In First Out

common operation in stacks:

- push (add) - add an item to the top of the stack
- pop (remove) - remove an item from the top of the stack
- peek - look at the item at the top of the stack without removing it

- Push will always be O(1)
- pop will always be O(1)
