## Review, Research, and Discussion

- Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
  -The software design becomes modular.
  - The code is easier to maintain.
  - Code refactoring goes more smoothly.
- In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
  - when you need to run a function before or after each test or set available variables for each test
- What is one downside of Test Driven Development
  - The tests are hard to write because the code is more complex to write and understand.
  - The development of the code is slow
- Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
  - This can be said to be a syntax base for constructor functions and instantiate objects using a new operator.
  - This also uses a new operator for object creation but focuses on how the objects are being instantiated.
- Why REST?
  - One of the key advantages of REST APIs is that they provide a great deal of flexibility. Data is not tied to resources or methods, so REST can handle multiple types of calls, return different data formats and even change structurally with the correct implementation of hypermedia.

Document the following Vocabulary Terms
| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
|functional programming|programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. This allows programs to be written in a declarative and composable style, where small functions are combined in a modular manner|
|object-oriented programming (OOP)|which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).|
|class|blueprint for creating objects. A class encapsulates data and functions that manipulate data. |
|super|The super keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent. The super.|
|this|The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to. ... Alone, this refers to the global object. In a function, this refers to the global object. In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined|
|Test Driven Development (TDD)|an iterate process that begins with writing a test code for an application or function before starting out to write the application|
|Jest|for creating, running, and structuring tests. |
|Continuous Integration (CI)|the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. |
|REST|The rest parameter syntax allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array,|
|Data Model| data model (or datamodel) is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate |
