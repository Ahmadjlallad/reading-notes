# Reading: Application State with Redux

## Review, Research, and Discussion

In your reading notes page for this class, provide answers to the following prompts. Cite any external sources

- What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”
  - It's just less convenient for the attacker because they can't read the content of the token although they rarely have to. It might also be more advantageous for the attacker to attack using victim's browser (by just sending that HTTP Request) rather than using the attacker's machine.
- Explain 3rd party cookies.

  - Third-party cookies are created by domains that are not the website (or domain) that you are visiting. These are usually used for online-advertising purposes and placed on a website through adding scripts or tags. A third-party cookie is accessible on any website that loads the third-party server's code.

- How do pixel tags work?

  - A tracking pixel (also called 1x1 pixel or pixel tag) is a graphic with dimensions of 1x1 pixels that is loaded when a user visits a webpage or opens an email
