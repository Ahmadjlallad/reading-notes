# Definition of Graph

A graph is also a mathematical non-linear data structure which can represent various kinds of physical structure. It consists of a group of vertices (or nodes) and set of edges that connect the two vertices. Vertices on the graph is represented as point or circles and edges are shown as arcs or line segments. An edge is represented by E(v,w) where v and w are the pairs of vertices. Removal of an edge from a circuit or connected graph creates a subgraph that is a tree.

The graphs are classified into various categories such as directed, non-directed, connected, non-connected, simple and multi-graph. Computer network, transportation system, social network graph, electrical circuits and project planning are some of the applications of graph data structure. It is also employed in management technique named as PERT (program evaluation and review technique) and CPM (critical path method) in which the graph structure is analysed.

- Directed vs Undirected

## Undirected graphs have edges that do not have a direction. The edges indicate a two-way relationship, in that each edge can be traversed in both directions. ... Directed graphs have edges with direction. The edges indicate a one-way relationship, in that each edge can only be traversed in a single direction

## A directed graph is graph, i.e., a set of objects (called vertices or nodes) that are connected together, where all the edges are directed from one vertex to another. ... In contrast, a graph where the edges are bidirectional is called an undirected graph

## Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected

Complete graphs are graphs that have an edge between every single vertex in the graph. A connected graph is a graph in which it's possible to get from every vertex in the graph to every other vertex through a series of edges, called a path.

### Complete Graphs

A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

A connected graph is graph that is connected in the sense of a topological space, i.e., there is a path from any point to any other point in the graph. A graph that is not connected is said to be disconnected. This definition means that the null graph and singleton graph are considered connected, while empty graphs on.

## Real World Uses of Graphs

Graphs are extremely popular when it comes to itâ€™s uses. Here are just a few examples of graphs in use:

GPS and Mapping
Driving Directions
Social Networks
Airline Traffic
Netflix uses graphs for suggestions of products
There is a lot to graphs, and a lot you can do with them. Let this be document be used as an introduction to graphs. There is a lot more to them then described, so start exploring, and have fun with them!
