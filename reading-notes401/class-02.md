## Review, Research, and Discussion

- What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?
  - PUT is used to update an existing resource and PATCH is used to update a portion of an existing resource.
- Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server
  - [https://www.npmjs.com/package/jayson](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jayson)
  - [https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-graphql-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-graphql-server)
  - [https://www.npmjs.com/package/fakerest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fakerest)
- Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?
  - Swagger uses 200 for successful calls and 400 for unsuccessful calls.
  - APIDoc.js uses 200 for successful calls and 400 for unsuccessful calls.
- Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST
  - SOAP is a protocol that uses XML to communicate with a web server.
  - ReST is a protocol that uses JSON to communicate with a web server.
