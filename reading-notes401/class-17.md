# Readings: AWS: S3 and Lambda

## Review, Research, and Discussion

- Describe “The Cloud”?
  - The cloud refers to software and services that run on the Internet, instead of locally on your computer.
- What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?

  - A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

- What is auto-scaling?

  - Auto-scaling is a feature that automatically adjusts the number of servers in an application to meet the demand of the user.

- What is bandwidth?
  - Bandwidth is the amount of data that can be transferred in a given time.
- How do cloud providers compute service costs?
  - Cloud providers compute service costs by charging for the number of requests made to the service.

| Server Instances        | A server instance is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Containers              | Containers are a form of operating system virtualization. A single container might be used to run anything from a small microservice or software process to a larger application. Inside a container are all the necessary executables, binary code, libraries, and configuration files. |

| Cloud Services          | Cloud services are infrastructure, platforms, or software that are hosted by third-party providers and made available to users through the internet.                                                                                                                                     |
| Cloud Architecture      | Cloud Architecture refers to the various components in terms of databases, software capabilities, applications, etc.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| AWS                     | Amazon Web Services, Inc. is a subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.                                                                                                 |
| EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku | The 30-thousand-foot comparison of these, Heroku and AWS Elastic Beanstalk, solutions (production configurations) is that they have comparable features and pricing.                                                                                                                     |

## Preparation Materials

- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
  - Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a web service that provides secure, durable, and resizable storage for data objects.
    [AWS Lambda Basics](https://www.serverless.com/aws-lambda)
- AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you.
- [AWS Lambda Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)

  - Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.

- [CDN](https://cyberhoot.com/cybrary/content-delivery-network-cdn/)
  - A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. A CDN allows for the fast transfer of data needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.
