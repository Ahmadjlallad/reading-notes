# Trees

In this tutorial, weâ€™ll be covering Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, and K-ary Trees. We will review some common terminology that is shared amongst all of the trees and then dive into specifics of the different types.

## Common Terminology

tree: a data structure that is either a leaf or has two branches.
leaf: a node that has no children.
branch = k: a node that has two children.
its a binary tree if it has only two branches.
Traversals
Depth First Search: DFS is a recursive algorithm that traverses a tree in a pre-order, in-order, or post-order fashion.
Breadth First Search: BFS is an iterative algorithm that traverses a tree in a level-order fashion.

Binary Tree Vs K-ary Trees

- The K-ary tree is a rooted tree, where each node can hold at most k number of children. If the value of k is 2, then this is known as binary tree. The binary tree, or ternary trees are some specialized k-ary trees.
